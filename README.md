SketchTiler Geometry Decomposition Demo

This project showcases a unified, browser-based demo of geometric preprocessing techniques relevant to the SketchTiler research project at UCSC.
The demo illustrates how rough user-drawn shapes can be converted into robust representations suitable for procedural generation, constraint-based layout, and Wave Function Collapse (WFC) pipelines.

The system supports arbitrary polygons, L-shapes, and donut-shapes (shapes with holes), and includes:

Grid snapping (orthogonalization of freehand sketches)

Rectangular decomposition

Triangulation decomposition

Bounding box generation

Donut classification (rectangular & circular donuts)

Visualization controls for before/after comparison

The goal is to make geometry preprocessing transparent, interactive, and demo-ready for presentations or research discussions.
